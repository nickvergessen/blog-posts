Once there was a day, where I could not remember my nickname, so I signed up a second time and used the fact as my name: nick-vergessen (english: username forgotten). In order to avoid highlight problems in IRC and more, I use nickv as short version.

However, my former university generated usernames based on the real names, which is why I sometimes end up with schilljs, like with my domain.

* Mastodon: [nickvergessen](https://mastodon.social/@nickvergessen)
* GitHub: [nickvergessen](https://github.com/nickvergessen)

## Main Languages
