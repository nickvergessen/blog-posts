Once there was a day, where I could not remember my nickname, so I signed up a second time and used the fact as my name: nick-vergessen (english: username forgotten). In order to avoid highlight problems in IRC and more, I use nickv as short version.

However my former university generated usernames based on the real names, which is why I sometimes end up with schilljs, like with my domain.

* Keybase: [nickvergessen](https://keybase.io/nickvergessen)
* Twitter: [nickvergessen](https://twitter.com/nickvergessen)
* GitHub: [nickvergessen](https://github.com/nickvergessen)
* IRC (Freenode.net): nickvergessen

## Languages

* PHP (10+ years)
* golang
* Basic knowledge: frontend (HTML, CSS, JS), python, ada, java
